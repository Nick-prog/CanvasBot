# Senior Design Bot
Welcome to our discord bot repository!
Our team started working on this project for our Senior Design Class during the Fall 2020 semester at Texas A&M University-Kingsville.
The final product will consists of several different features such as:
Web service account notifications, calendar event retrievals, file downloading/uploading capabilities, etc...

Join us as we try to accomplish a task that will challenge us at every corner and put our knowledge to the test!

Please check out the following GitHub repositories if you wish to pursue a similar endeavor in Discord or Canvas.

Discord API - https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

Canvas API - https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi

The purpose of this project can be answered in the following three questions:

What advantages does discord have over other platforms such as BB, in terms of video and collaboration?:

        Discord is part of a new landscape for digital collaboration software that has the advantage when it comes to creativity for user interactions. Its open source API allows         for any users to create a work space suitable to their needs while also providing better video quality and collaboration tools for any occasion.
  
For this project, why make the users have to interact with discord instead of going to the Canvas website? If not, what would you classify this project as?:

        Discord is not intended to be the wall between Canvas and its users but instead a simple to use tool that can make everyday operations in Canvas that much easier. The             users are given two options instead of one when it comes to collaboration or video calls in an easy to use software that many have become familiar with.
  
How does this impact lower-income school districts?:

        Our plan for this project is to eliminate the need to pay for hosting services through Canvas. We can do this by having schools host their our own servers through services         such as Google Cloud. Discord would then provide all collaboration needs while the Canvas server will provide all database needs.
        
Thus, we can split this project idea into two different areas of interest. Creating a ease-of-life tool for Discord and Canvas users, as well as, potential creating a Cavnas/Blackboard alternative for lower-income school districts that will focus on utilizing Discord's communication/callaboration tools and Canvas LMS's database/web service functionailties.
